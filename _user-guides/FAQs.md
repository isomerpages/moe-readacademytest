<h3><strong>Resources: E-books and Audiobooks</strong></h3>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Where do the ebooks/audiobooks come from?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Most of the ebooks/audiobooks are from OverDrive, the global distributor
of digital content for libraries and schools. Leading digital content platform
for libraries and schools.&nbsp;OverDrive is headquartered at Cleveland,
Ohio.&nbsp;It is used by public libraries, schools, polytechnics, universities
and corporations worldwide. Locally, NLB and some schools, Institute of
Higher Learning libraries and specialised libraries are subscribers to
OverDrive.</p>
<p>OverDrive also provides the platform for using their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The designated platform for schools is Sora, the student reading app,
while Libby is the library reading app for public libraries like NLB.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Besides OverDrive, READ@Academy also carries some ebooks from EBSCO.&nbsp;These
are searchable via OPAC and also accessible via the EBSCO Discovery platform.</p>
</div>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>What is the difference between READ@Academy’s SORA and NLB’s Libby?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Sora and Libby are both apps and websites that allow users to access eBooks
and audiobooks from OverDrive. SORA is the reading platform that schools
use, while Libby is the public library equivalent of SORA.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main difference between the two is that SORA connects to a school’s
library, while Libby allows residents to check out ebooks and audiobooks
from their local library. For READ@Academy's users, we recommend using
the SORA app, as it has been configured to also enable the searching of
NLB's adult collection.</p>
