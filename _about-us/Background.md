<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>READ@Academy (Resources for Education and Development @ Academy for Singapore
Teachers) is a specialised library which aims to provide quality information
resources and services to support the professional and personal development
of officers in the education service.</p>
<p>Teachers, Allied Educators (AEDs) and Executive Administrative Staff (EAS)
enjoy membership privileges at READ@Academy. With a large collection of
books and multimedia resources, READ@Academy aims to provide our officers
with ready access to useful teaching aids and education-related literature
for continual learning in the profession.</p>
<p>READ@Academyâ€™s predecessor is READ@TN (Resources for Education and Development
@ Teachers Network). Formed in April 2001, READ@TN was expanded from the
former ETRC (Educational Technology Resource Centre) to a full-fledged
library that included both print and non-print collections. After the launch
of Academy of Singapore Teachers on 6 September 2010, the library was renamed
READ@Academy and its collection was henceforth developed in line with the
vision and mission of the new Academy of Singapore Teachers.</p>
<p>In March 2013, the MOEHQ Library, located at the Ministry of Education
Headquarters building, was merged with READ@Academy. The name of the merged
library remains as READ@Academy.</p>
